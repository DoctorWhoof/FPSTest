TO DO: Code:
Blend Material (mask based).
Fly camera.
Reset position.

TO DO: Art:
BLOCK EVERYTHING BEFORE ADDING DETAIL!
Castle ruins! Lots of scattered geometry, props, doors, windows, flag poles, etc. Look for reference.
New architecture: walls, bridge, more spectacular castle ruins.
New material areas: roads, castle grounds around walls with dead grass.
Playtest geometry: Ramps, ladders, stairs.

Intensify global amb occlusion in Painter.
Add extra detail in heightmap (normals still blurry).
